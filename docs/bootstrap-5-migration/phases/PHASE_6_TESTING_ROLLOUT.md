# Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing & Staged Rollout

**Duration:** 6 weeks (Sprints 22-24)
**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Comprehensive testing and staged production rollout of Bootstrap 5 migration

---

## Overview

Phase 6 is the final phase focused on ensuring the Bootstrap 5 migration is production-ready and executing a safe, staged rollout. This phase includes:

1. **Comprehensive testing** across all modules, content types, and integrations
2. **Documentation** for developers, site builders, and end users
3. **Staged rollout** using the multi-tier Y USA strategy (D â†’ C â†’ B â†’ A)
4. **Monitoring and support** during and after rollout

**Key Strategy:** Test thoroughly, document extensively, roll out incrementally, monitor closely.

**Critical Success Factor:** No major issues during rollout to A-tier sites.

- Development environments
- Internal testing sites

**Success Criteria:**
- Site functional
- No critical errors
- Core features working

### Tier C: Staging & Testing Sites
**Timeline:** Sprint 23, Week 2
**Sites:** Staging, QA, UAT environments
**Purpose:** Final user acceptance testing
**Risk:** LOW
**Rollback Plan:** Quick rollback if issues found

**Sites in Tier C:**
- Staging sites
- QA environments
- UAT sites for partners

**Success Criteria:**
- All functionality working
- User acceptance sign-off
- No high-priority bugs

### Tier B: Small Production Sites
**Timeline:** Sprint 24, Week 1

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Critical Bug Found During Testing (MEDIUM)
**Impact:** HIGH - Could delay rollout
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Allocate entire Sprint 22 to testing and fixes
- Triage bugs by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Fix critical and high bugs before rollout
- Document medium/low bugs as known issues
- Have contingency plan (extend Sprint 22 if needed)

**Bug Triage Criteria:**
- **Critical:** Site down, data loss, security issue â†’ Must fix before rollout
- **High:** Major feature broken, bad user experience â†’ Must fix before A-tier
- **Medium:** Minor feature issue, cosmetic â†’ Fix in next release
- **Low:** Edge case, minor cosmetic â†’ Document as known issue

### Risk 2: Performance Regression (MEDIUM)
**Impact:** HIGH - Poor user experience
**Probability:** LOW
**Mitigation:**
- Baseline performance metrics from Bootstrap 4 version
- Compare Bootstrap 5 metrics to baseline
- Optimize bundles (webpack optimization)
- Optimize images (lazy loading)
- Use CDN for static assets
- Monitor performance during rollout
- Have performance optimization sprint ready if needed

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Page load time: < 3 seconds (3G)
- JavaScript bundle: No more than 10% increase
- CSS bundle: Should decrease (Bootstrap 5 is smaller)

### Risk 3: Accessibility Regression (MEDIUM)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Legal and ethical issues
**Probability:** LOW
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive accessibility testing in Sprint 22
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation testing
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance verification
- Fix all accessibility issues before rollout
- Have accessibility expert review if needed

**Accessibility Red Lines:**
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- All images have alt text
- All forms have labels
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- Focus indicators visible
- Screen reader announcements work

### Risk 4: Rollout Issues (HIGH)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Production sites down or broken
**Probability:** LOW (with proper testing)
**Mitigation:**
- Staged rollout (D â†’ C â†’ B â†’ A)
- Test each tier before proceeding
- Monitor each tier closely
- Have rollback plan ready
- Have support team on standby
- Communicate rollout schedule to stakeholders
- Schedule rollouts during low-traffic periods

**Rollback Criteria:**
- Critical bug affecting core functionality
- Site performance degraded significantly
- Major accessibility issues
- User complaints exceed threshold
- Security issue discovered

### Risk 5: Documentation Incomplete (LOW)
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Hard to maintain/troubleshoot
**Probability:** LOW
**Mitigation:**
- Allocate full Sprint 23 for documentation
- Create documentation checklist
- Have technical writer review
- Include code examples
- Include screenshots
- Document known issues
- Document troubleshooting steps

### Risk 6: User Resistance to Changes (LOW)
**Impact:** LOW - Users may complain about visual changes
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Minimize visual changes (Bootstrap 5 very similar to 4)
- Communicate changes in advance
- Provide before/after screenshots
- Explain benefits (performance, security, future features)
- Have support resources ready
- Monitor feedback channels
