# Decision: Bootstrap 5 Migration Rollout Strategy

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision Makers:** Product Owner, Technical Lead, DevOps Lead
**Scope:** Deployment and rollout of Bootstrap 5 migration across Y USA Open YMCA platform

---

## Problem Statement

The Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5 migration affects every page, component, and user interaction across the Y USA Open YMCA platform. A single "big bang" deployment carries unacceptable risks:

### Risks of Big Bang Deployment

1. **Catastrophic Failure:** One critical bug could break the entire platform for 500+ YMCA sites
2. **Difficult Rollback:** Reverting thousands of changes is complex and time-consuming
3. **Limited Testing:** Cannot thoroughly test every edge case in non-production environments
4. **User Impact:** All users experience issues simultaneously, overwhelming support
5. **Pressure on Team:** Entire team on-call for emergency fixes, burnout risk
6. **Reputation Damage:** Multiple simultaneous issues erode trust in platform
7. **No Learning:** Cannot incorporate lessons learned from early issues

### Business Context

**Platform Scale:**
- **Sites:** 500+ YMCA sites using this distribution
- **Users:** Millions of annual visitors across all sites
- **Critical Functions:** Program registration, membership management, donations, class scheduling
- **Revenue Impact:** Site downtime directly impacts YMCA revenue (registrations, donations)
- **Support Capacity:** Small support team cannot handle mass simultaneous issues

**Stakeholder Concerns:**
- **YMCA Site Owners:** Fear of disruption to their operations
- **End Users:** Expect seamless experience, intolerant of bugs
- **Development Team:** Need ability to fix issues without panic
- **Product Owners:** Balance risk with need to modernize platform

---

## Rollout Strategy: Multi-Tier Progressive Deployment

We propose a **four-tier staged rollout** that progressively exposes the Bootstrap 5 migration to increasing numbers of users while maintaining the ability to quickly identify and fix issues.

### Tier System Overview

| Tier | Name | Audience | Sites | Risk | Duration | Rollback |
|------|------|----------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **D** | Internal | Dev team, staging | 3-5 | Lowest | 2 weeks | Easy |
| **C** | Pilot | Volunteer YMCAs | 10-15 | Low | 4 weeks | Easy |
| **B** | Early Adopters | Progressive YMCAs | 50-100 | Medium | 6 weeks | Moderate |
| **A** | General Availability | All remaining sites | 400+ | Higher | 8 weeks | Complex |

**Total Rollout Timeline:** 20 weeks (5 months)

**Philosophy:** "Test in production, but limit the blast radius"

---

## Tier D: Internal Deployment (Dev & Staging)

### Objective

Validate the migration in production-like environments with internal team members who can quickly identify and fix issues.

---

### Scope

**Environments:**
1. **Development environments:** All developer Docksal instances
2. **CI/CD environments:** All PR preview builds
3. **Internal staging:** Main staging environment (staging.yusaopeny.org)
4. **Demo site:** Public demo site (demo.yusaopeny.org)
5. **Internal sites:** Y USA internal sites (2-3 sites)

**Users:**
- Development team (15-20 people)
- QA team (2-3 people)
- Product owners (3-5 people)
- Y USA staff (50-100 people using internal sites)

**Traffic:** <1% of total platform traffic

   - Prepare blog post announcement
   - Record video walkthrough
   - Update all documentation
   - Prepare social media announcements
   - Draft press release (if applicable)

5. **Go/No-Go Meeting (Day 5):**
   - Final review of all success criteria

   - Final decision to proceed

**Week 2-5: Phased GA Deployment (10-15 deployment waves)**

**Deployment Strategy:**

Deploy in waves of 25-40 sites each, with 1-2 days between waves. This allows:
- Time to identify issues before they affect many sites
- Support team to manage ticket volume
- Monitoring team to analyze metrics between waves
- Ability to pause deployment if widespread issues emerge

**Wave Schedule:**

```yaml
Wave 1: 25-30 sites (Week 2, Monday)
  - Focus: Small YMCAs, lower risk
  - Monitoring: Intensive (every 2 hours)

Wave 2: 25-30 sites (Week 2, Wednesday)
  - Focus: Mix of small and medium YMCAs
  - Monitoring: Intensive (every 2 hours)

Wave 3: 30-35 sites (Week 2, Friday)
  - Focus: Mix of medium YMCAs
  - Monitoring: Intensive (every 4 hours)

Wave 4: 30-35 sites (Week 3, Monday)
  - Focus: Mix of medium and large YMCAs
  - Monitoring: Standard (every 4 hours)

Wave 5-10: 30-40 sites each (Week 3-4, Mon/Wed/Fri)
  - Focus: Remaining medium and large YMCAs
  - Monitoring: Standard (every 6 hours)

Wave 11-15: 25-35 sites each (Week 5, Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri)
  - Focus: Final sites, including any held back for specific reasons
  - Monitoring: Standard (daily)
```

**Per-Wave Process:**

```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment checks
ansible-playbook pre-deploy-checks.yml --limit waveN_sites
# Verify sites are healthy, backups recent, etc.

# 2. Deployment
ansible-playbook deploy-bootstrap5.yml --limit waveN_sites
# Enable Bootstrap 5, clear caches, verify

# 3. Post-deployment verification
ansible-playbook post-deploy-verify.yml --limit waveN_sites
# Verify sites load, no critical errors

# 4. Notification
./send-deployment-notifications.sh waveN_sites
# Email site admins

# 5. Monitoring
# Watch dashboards for error spikes, performance issues
# Support team monitoring tickets
```

**Between Waves:**
- Analyze metrics from previous wave

### Metrics to Monitor

**GA-Specific Dashboards:**

```yaml
# Overall Platform Health
- Platform-Wide Error Rate:
    metric: errors_per_1000_page_views
    baseline: Tier B average
    threshold: <110% of baseline
    alert: >130% of baseline

- Platform-Wide Performance:
    metrics:
      - LCP (75th percentile)
      - FID (75th percentile)
      - CLS (75th percentile)
    baseline: Tier B average
    threshold: within 10% of baseline
    alert: >20% degradation

- Deployment Progress:
    metric: percent_sites_migrated
    target: 100% by end Week 5
    track: daily

- Support Ticket Volume:
    metric: bootstrap5_tickets_per_day
    baseline: Tier B average per site
    threshold: <2x baseline
    alert: >3x baseline

# Per-Wave Analysis
- Wave Health Score:
    per_wave_metrics:
      - error_rate
      - performance
      - support_tickets
      - user_satisfaction
    identify: problematic waves
    investigate: root causes

# Business Metrics (Aggregated)
- Platform-Wide Conversions:
    metrics:
      - total_program_registrations
      - total_memberships
      - total_donations
    baseline: same period last year + Tier B
    threshold: within 10% of baseline
    alert: >15% decrease

# Individual Site Monitoring
- High-Value Site Tracking:
    sites: top 50 by traffic/revenue
    monitoring: intensive (hourly)
    alerts: immediate for any issues

- At-Risk Site Tracking:
    sites: custom code, past issues, special configurations
    monitoring: enhanced (every 2 hours)
    alerts: early warning for issues
```

---

### Rollback Procedure

**Individual Site Rollback:**

```bash
# For site-specific issues
ansible-playbook rollback-bootstrap5.yml --limit problem_site

# Investigate and document root cause
# Fix issue or accept workaround
# Redeploy when ready
```

**Wave Rollback:**

```bash
# If wave has widespread issues
ansible-playbook rollback-bootstrap5.yml --limit waveN_sites

# Pause further deployments
# Investigate and fix root cause
# Redeploy wave after fix
```

**Partial Rollback (High-Value Sites):**

```bash
# If critical sites affected, rollback those only
ansible-playbook rollback-bootstrap5.yml --limit high_value_sites

# Keep other sites on Bootstrap 5
# Fix issue urgently
# Redeploy high-value sites ASAP
```

**Platform-Wide Rollback (Nuclear Option):**

```bash
# Only if catastrophic failure
# Rollback ALL sites to Bootstrap 4
ansible-playbook rollback-bootstrap5.yml --limit all

# This should be avoided at all costs
# Represents complete failure of migration strategy
# Extensive retrospective required before retry
```

**Rollback Decision Criteria:**

**Individual Site:**
- Site-specific critical bug
- Custom code incompatibility
- Site owner requests rollback

**Wave:**
- >25% of wave sites experiencing issues
- Critical bug affecting entire wave
- Performance degradation >30%

**Platform-Wide (only if):**
- Security vulnerability affecting all sites
- Data corruption or loss
- Critical bug affecting >30% of all sites
- Complete failure of core functionality (program registration, payment processing)
- Multiple simultaneous catastrophic failures

## Risk Management

### Risk: Deployment Automation Failure

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Test deployment automation extensively in Tier C/B
- Manual deployment procedures documented as backup
- Smaller wave sizes in Tier A allow manual deployment if needed

**Contingency:**
- Switch to manual deployment if automation fails
- Deploy smaller waves (10-15 sites) manually
- Extend timeline to accommodate manual process

---

### Risk: Overwhelming Support Volume

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Phased deployment spreads support load over time
- Comprehensive documentation and FAQs reduce tickets
- War room during peak deployment weeks
- Escalation procedures for critical issues

**Contingency:**
- Pause deployments if support overwhelmed
- Bring in additional support contractors
- Prioritize critical issues, defer minor ones
- Extend timeline to reduce support load

---

### Risk: Widespread Unexpected Issue

**Likelihood:** Low (due to Tier C/B validation)
**Impact:** Very High

**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing in Tier C/B should catch issues
- Phased Tier A deployment limits blast radius
- Monitoring catches issues early
- Rapid rollback capability

**Contingency:**
- Pause all deployments immediately
- Rollback affected waves
- Emergency bug fix sprint
- Communicate transparently with YMCAs
- Resume deployment after fix validated

---

### Risk: High-Profile Site Failure

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High (reputational)

**Mitigation:**
- Extra attention to high-traffic sites
- Deploy high-profile sites in early waves (more time to fix issues)
- Enhanced monitoring for high-value sites
- Direct communication channel with high-profile site admins

**Contingency:**
- Immediate rollback of affected site
- Emergency fix with top priority
- Direct communication with site stakeholders
- Post-incident review and remediation

---

### Risk: Timeline Extension

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- 20% buffer built into timeline
- Clear go/no-go criteria at each tier
- Flexibility to extend specific phases if needed

**Contingency:**
- Communicate timeline changes early and transparently
- Adjust wave schedule to accommodate delays
- Ensure support team capacity for extended timeline
- Re-evaluate resource allocation if significant delay
